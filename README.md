**Krs Contract**  

This script allows players to sell vehicles to each other in a realistic and secure way:  
- **Detects nearby players** and lets you select them through an interface.  
- Verifies vehicle ownership and handles the ownership transfer in the database.  
- **Financial management**: transfers money between buyer and seller via inventory.  
- Includes **custom animations and notifications** to enhance the user experience.  
- Features a **Discord logging system** to track every transaction.  

Perfect for RP servers looking for a smooth and immersive vehicle sales system! ðŸš—
